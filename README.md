# Third-Party APIs - Weather Dashboard

## Description
In order learn more about third-party APIs and retrieving & using data from another application's API, I created a simple weather dashboard that runs in the browswer and feautures dynamically updated HTML and CSS code powered by jQuery and the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library.

- Used the [OpenWeather current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) to retrieve current weather data for cities. 
- Used the [OpenWeather 5 day/3 hour forecast data](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve forecasted weather data for cities.

## Usage

Application deployed at the following link: https://park-d.github.io/weather-dashboard-module6/

When a user opens the page, they are presented with a header and a simple search box. When they type in a valid city name, they are presented with the current location, date, an icon of the current weather, temperature, wind, and humidity. They also receive a 5 day forecast with the same traits. When they search a city, it gets saved onto the browser for future use, and to recall after other searches. They can also clear their search history at any point.
